Objective: Ensure that every button and interactive element on the SCHWARZES SCHILD BANK dashboard is fully functional. For any non-responsive elements, implement the corresponding pages or features. Enhance the overall user interface to align with premium banking standards, ensuring a professional and trustworthy user experience.
1. Interactive Elements Audit

    Action: Review all buttons and interactive components on the dashboard to verify their functionality.

    Implementation:

        For each button, ensure it is linked to the appropriate page or triggers the correct function.

        If a button is non-functional, create a placeholder page or modal indicating that the feature is under development.

        Example:

        <a href="transfer.html" class="btn btn-primary">Transfer Funds</a>

        If transfer.html does not exist, create a basic page with a message: "Transfer Funds feature is coming soon."

2. Page Creation for Missing Features

    Action: Identify and create pages for any missing features linked from the dashboard.

    Implementation:

        Develop the following pages if they are not already present:

            transfer.html

            exchange.html

            cards.html

            statement.html

            settings.html

            profile.html

            security.html

            support.html

        Each page should have a consistent layout and design, even if the functionality is not yet implemented.

3. Bug Identification and Resolution

    Action: Test the dashboard for any bugs or errors.

    Implementation:

        Use browser developer tools to inspect console logs for errors.

        Address any JavaScript errors or broken links.

        Ensure that all form submissions and button clicks perform the intended actions or provide appropriate feedback.

4. User Interface Enhancements

    Action: Refine the dashboard's UI to reflect a premium banking experience.

    Implementation:

        Maintain a consistent color scheme, typography, and layout across all pages.

        Use high-quality icons and images that align with the bank's branding.

        Ensure responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

5. Accessibility and User Experience

    Action: Improve accessibility and overall user experience.

    Implementation:

        Add aria-labels to buttons and interactive elements for screen readers.

        Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds.

        Provide clear feedback for user actions, such as loading indicators or success messages.

6. Testing and Validation

    Action: Conduct thorough testing of the dashboard.

    Implementation:

        Test all functionalities across different browsers and devices.

        Validate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to ensure compliance with web standards.
