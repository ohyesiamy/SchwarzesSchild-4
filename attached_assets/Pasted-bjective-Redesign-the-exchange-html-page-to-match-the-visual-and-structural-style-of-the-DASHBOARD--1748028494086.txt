bjective: Redesign the exchange.html page to match the visual and structural style of the DASHBOARD, while integrating secure, professional-grade exchange functionality. The interface should evoke confidence, control, and clarity—reflecting a top-tier financial institution.
🎨 Visual Design Guidelines (Same as DASHBOARD)

    Layout & Structure

        Use the same grid system, spacing (32px padding), and card modular layout as the DASHBOARD.

        Section headers should use text-xl font-semibold.

        Place all exchange tools inside styled white containers with subtle borders (border-gray-200) and clean black titles.

    Typography & Color Scheme

        Font: Use Helvetica Neue, Segoe UI, or Noto Sans

        Font size: 16px body, 20–24px headings

        Black/white color scheme only — no gradients, no shadows

        Use clear iconography (outlined arrows, currency symbols)

🔧 Core Features to Implement

    Show a table or scrollable block:

        USD ⇄ EUR

        Each line should show:

            Rate
