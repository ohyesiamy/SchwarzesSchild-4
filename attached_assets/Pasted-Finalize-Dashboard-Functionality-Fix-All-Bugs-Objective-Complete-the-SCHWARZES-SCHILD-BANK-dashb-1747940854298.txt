Finalize Dashboard Functionality & Fix All Bugs

Objective: Complete the SCHWARZES SCHILD BANK dashboard by ensuring every button and feature is fully functional. If any button leads to a missing page or action, generate a placeholder or corresponding module immediately. The user experience must feel solid, seamless, and enterprise-grade.
✅ Implementation Checklist:

    🔘 Button Functionality Audit

        Test every interactive button or link:

            Transfer Funds

            Receive

            Download Statement

            Freeze Card

            Add Account

            Currency Exchange

            Settings / Profile

        If any action is non-responsive, create and bind the appropriate page or modal.

    ⚙️ Missing Feature Handling

        If a button has no destination or functionality:

            Create a placeholder page (.html) or modal component with a “Coming Soon” or simulated response.

            Example:

            <div class="modal">
              <h2>Currency Exchange</h2>
              <p>This feature is under simulated preview. Exchange rates will be available shortly.</p>
            </div>

    🚧 Generate Missing Pages

        Create the following if not already implemented:

            /transfer.html

            /exchange.html

            /cards.html

            /statement.html

            /settings.html

            /profile.html

            /security.html

            /support.html

    🪛 Bug Fixes

        Resolve any JS errors in console

        Check all onclick, href, or form handlers for broken logic or empty callbacks

        Ensure all links are relative paths and not broken on Replit deployment

    🧪 Testing Protocol

        Test in both desktop and mobile view

        Verify:

            Page loads correctly

            Content is scrollable where needed

            Modals or drawers open and close smoothly

            Buttons have active hover + click states

        Use dummy actions where backend isn’t live (e.g., simulate success toast: “✔ Transfer Successful”)

    🎯 Final Polish

        Add cursor-pointer to all clickable elements

        Add tooltips (title="...") where appropriate

        Ensure visual feedback exists for all interactions (button clicks, hover changes, modal open/close)
