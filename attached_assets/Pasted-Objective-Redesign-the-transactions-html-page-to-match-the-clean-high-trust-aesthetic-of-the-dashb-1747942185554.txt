Objective: Redesign the transactions.html page to match the clean, high-trust aesthetic of the dashboard. Add key banking features including domestic transfer, international transfer, self-to-self transfer, and scheduled internal transfers, all within a structured, user-centric layout.
🎨 UI Redesign Guidelines (Match Dashboard Aesthetic)

    Use the same grid structure, font hierarchy, and white-black color scheme as the dashboard.

    Organize sections into modular cards with section headers like:

        Transfer Options

        Transaction History

        Scheduled Transfers

    Maintain spacing: 32px padding inside sections, 48px margin between blocks.

    Add a sticky or collapsible sidebar (optional) for quick actions.
